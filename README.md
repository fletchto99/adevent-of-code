# Advent of Code

## 2018

This year I'm attempting at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
by using a new language every day. Some friends helped me create a list of languages of which I can pick from. Each day I first solve the problem in Python (or something similar) to help me understand the problem as well as creating a solution to remain competitive in my private leaderboards. Then over the next few days, time permitting, I will pick a language and come up with a solution in that language for at least one part of the problem.

## Solutions

- [Day 1: Brainfuck](2018/Day%201/part1.b) (only part 1)

- Day 3: Hodor (TBD)
