# Advent of Code

## 2018

This year I'm attempting at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
by using a new language every day. Some friends helped me create a list of languages of which I can pick from. Each day I first solve the problem in Python (or something similar) to help me understand the problem as well as creating a solution to remain competitive in my private leaderboards. Then over the next few days, time permitting, I will pick a language and come up with a solution in that language for at least one part of the problem.

## Charity

For every hour a solution takes me (up to 5 hours per solution) I will donate $2 to a charity of my choosing at the end of the event. I chose a large interval of time because I'm learning a new language each day, if the solution takes me less than an hour then I will use a 10 minute interval up to 50 minutes.

### Charity Update

Since these solutions have been taking me longer than expected to complete I've decided to [donate $200](https://i.fletchto99.com/4edc8047.png) towards the GitHub fund. The GitHub fund is a fund created by my employer, where the proceeds split equally and go to 6 different charities. The 6 charities these funds went to are: [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/), [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/), [Public Patent Foundation](http://www.pubpat.org/), [Year Up](https://www.yearup.org/), [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) and [Women's Refugee Commission](https://www.womensrefugeecommission.org/). GitHub graciously matched my donation totaling $400 to be split. If I am unable to complete my goal of a new language every day by the end of December I will donate another $50 to the GitHub fund.

### Charity Update 2

Near the end of December I ended up being much busier than expected. I haven't had time to finish the challenges so I've donated another [$50](https://i.fletchto99.com/aafe768a.png) towards the GitHub fund. Once again, GitHub generously matched the donation. Thanks for the fun during advent of code! Although I wasn't able to finish in the 25 days I did truly enjoy the challenges. I plan to complete the rest of the challenges over the next while! See you next year!
