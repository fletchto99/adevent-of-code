# Advent of Code

## 2018

This year I'm attempting at solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
by using a new language every day. Some friends helped me create a list of languages of which I can pick from. Each day I first solve the problem in Python (or something similar) to help me understand the problem as well as creating a solution to remain competitive in my private leaderboards. Then over the next few days, time permitting, I will pick a language and come up with a solution in that language for at least one part of the problem.

## Charity

For every hour a solution takes me (up to 5 hours per solution) I will donate $2 to a charity of my choosing at the end of the event. I chose a large interval of time because I'm learning a new language each day, if the solution takes me less than an hour then I will use a 10 minute interval up to 50 minutes.
